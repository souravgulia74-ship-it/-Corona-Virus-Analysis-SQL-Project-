# 🦠 Corona Virus Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **Corona Virus (COVID-19) data** using **SQL**. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the dataset by writing SQL queries that answer important analytical questions about the spread, recovery, and impact of the virus across different regions.

This project was created as part of an internship to demonstrate real-world **data analysis and SQL skills**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Province** – Geographic subdivision within a country/region  
- **Country/Region** – Geographic entity where data is recorded  
- **Latitude** – North-south position on Earth’s surface  
- **Longitude** – East-west position on Earth’s surface  
- **Date** – Recorded date of CORONA VIRUS data  
- **Confirmed** – Number of diagnosed CORONA VIRUS cases  
- **Deaths** – Number of CORONA VIRUS related deaths  
- **Recovered** – Number of recovered CORONA VIRUS cases  

---

## 🛠️ Tasks
The analysis involves solving **16 SQL-based questions** from the reference file.  
These questions cover areas such as:

- Identifying trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries  
- Tracking spread across countries and provinces  
- Finding peak infection dates  
- Mortality and recovery rate analysis  
- Regional comparisons and aggregations

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated
- SQL Query Writing  
- Data Aggregation & Filtering  
- Time-Series Analysis  
- Data Exploration & Reporting

## 📊 Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, you will have:  
✅ A set of SQL queries that provide insights into COVID-19 spread and impact  
✅ A structured approach to real-world **data analysis problems**  
✅ Stronger command of **SQL for analytics**
